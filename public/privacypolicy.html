    <h1>HODL Monitor Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This site does not intentionally collect or store any data remotely, show ads, or use any analytics tracking software. The app is built so that no personally identifiable data is necessary and all user data is stored locally on the device.</p>
    <h3>Use of External Services</h3> 
    <p>The app does make a few external service (API) calls but does not intentionally send any identifiable user/device data to those services. While care is taken in how this site interacts with those services, this site cannot make any claims to how those services perform or what they do with incoming requests.</p>
    <p>The app relies on the following services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CoinGecko - The site is <a target="_blank" href="https://coingecko.com/en/api">Powered by CoinGecko API</a> to which it will pass a list of symbols for pricing data. Amounts are not sent and there are no user tokens sent alongside the list as this is a public API.</li>
      <li>Google Fonts - for, well, fonts. You can view their statement on privacy regarding this service at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users" target="_blank">Google Fonts FAQ</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>The app was built as a hobby and no support, liability, or warranty is provided. Accuracy is not guaranteed. This should not be used to make investment decisions.</p>
